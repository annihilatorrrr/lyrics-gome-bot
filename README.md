## Getting started

To start using the bot, you need to start it by clicking the start button. You can also run the bot command to get started:

## How to use the bot

Imagine that you want to find the lyrics of a song that you are listening to now. You have already started the bot to work. All you need to do is write the name of the song or the name of the artist.

Let's look at the work of the bot on the example of the song "HUMBLE.", which was written and sung by Kendrick Lamar. You can write in uppercase or lowercase letters.

Let's write "Humble" in our bot:

    Humble


The bot will show us information about all the songs where the word "Humble" occurs. For example, consider 3 songs:

    HUMBLE. - Kendrick Lamar
    Humble and Kind - Tim McGraw
    Humble - Lil Baby

We will choose " HUMBLE. - Kendrick Lamar". Next, our bot will display the image of the artist's song or album and the lyrics of the song.

    Nobody pray for me
    It been that day for me
    Way (Yeah, yeah)

    [Verse 1]
    Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
    Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
    Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin' this
    D’USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
    Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
    Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
    ...
